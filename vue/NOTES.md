# Wagtail + Vue.js Notes

## Intro
- Goals
  - Lay some foundation for using Wagtail as a headless CMS
  - Learn more about the inner workings of Wagtail and Vue.js
- Vue is a javascript framework commonly used for building user interfaces and single page applications.

## Flavor
- I'm not stopping here
- How can we improve this
- Library agnostic, should be able to reproduce results in any framework (React, etc.)

## Scaffolding with `vue-cli`
```
# Install vue-cli
npm install -g @vue/cli

# Create new project in folder "vue"
vue create vue

# Options:
# manually select features: Babel, Router, Linter / Formatter
# user history mode for router (yes)
# eslint + prettier
# disable lint on save, enable lint + fix on commit
# in dedicated config files
# save as a preset (no)

# Move into project folder
cd vue

# Start development server
npm run serve
```
